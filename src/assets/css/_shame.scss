  This is the place for shameful CSS solutions. 
  (Also see: https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/)
  
  Make sure to document all those nasty hacks with comments:
 
   1. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
   2. Why was this needed?
   3. How does this fix it?
   4. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
 
  You can also sue this as a good place to introduce custom CSS before organizing.

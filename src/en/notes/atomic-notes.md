Atomic notes are single, self-contained notes that capture a single idea or piece of information. They are meant to be read and understood without needing to refer to anything more.

They can be connected to another atomic note or idea in some way. By breaking down complex ideas into smaller, atomic notes, one can make their notes more organized and easier to review later.

Tags: #exercise #health #wellness

Regular exercise confers numerous health benefits, including:

- Improved cardiovascular health
- Increased strength and flexibility
- Weight management
- Reduced risk of chronic diseases

It is recommended to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Exercise should be a combination of aerobic activity, strength training, and flexibility exercises.

Exercise not only improves physical health but also enhances mental well-being. It helps relieve stress, improve mood, and boost cognitive function.

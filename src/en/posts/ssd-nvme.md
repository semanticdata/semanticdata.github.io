The main goal for this post was to aid in selecting SSD, and NVMe drives during a Micro Center sale.

## Storage Technologies

### 3D NAND

- The most basic of modern SSD technologies. Great for throwing on cheap systems, home servers, anything non-critical really.
- It is not recommended to host your Operating System on 3D NAND, or QLC.

### Quad Level Cell (QLC)

- QLC (Quad Level Cell) is cheaper to manufacture than TLC (Triple Level Cell).
- QLC is much slower and less durable to constant writing than TLC.
- It is not recommended to host your Operating System on 3D NAND, or QLC.

### Triple Level Cell (TLC)

- TLC is more reliable when compared to QLC.
- MLC is a Triple Level Cell based Samsung technology.

### Multi Level Cell (MLC)

- MLC is a Triple Level Cell based Samsung technology.

Let's break it down:

1. MLC V-NAND (Best)
2. V-NAND (TLC Equiv.)
3. TLC (V-NAND Equiv.)
4. QLC (Cheap, less reliable)
5. 3D NAND (Basic)

## How Are SSDs Scored

### Storage

- 1 point per GB
  - Less accurate the bigger the SSD
  - 3Â TB and higher drives scale exp/log instead of linearly.

### Price

Based on price per $1.
Selected $0.10 as the baseline after averaging some calculations.

- 1 point for every $0.01 / GB below $0.10

### Technology Coefficient

- 3D NAND Coefficient = 0.5 (Big Penalty)
- QLC Coefficient = 0.75 (Small Penalty)
- TLC Coefficient = 1.0 (No Change)
- MLC V-NAND coefficient = 1.25 (Small Advantage)

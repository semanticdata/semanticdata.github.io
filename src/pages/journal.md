This page explores the concept of keeping a public journal, something I haven't done before. I'm still defining what exactly I should include in this journal. I'm currently making sure it's not too technical, or difficult to read.

## 2024

### April

- Helped a good friend study for some certifications they are testing for. Felt great knowing they were no longer feeling as much pressure afterwards. ðŸ˜Š
- Learning more about Git. I recently signed up for an account on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht).
  - Practicing adding remotes, renaming them, pushing to multiple remotes simultaneously.

### March

- Backed up my past personal websites inside [semanticdata.github.io](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) using a different branch.
  - It now sits with a few other previous personal websites and blogs I have backup on the repo.
- Currently using [Eleventy Vite](https://github.com/matthiasott/eleventy-plus-vite) to publish [MiguelPimente.do](https://miguelpimentel.do).
  - The plan is to transition to a new starter I'm working on.
- Refreshed all my notes within [Forgetful Notes](https://forgetfulnotes.com/). Revised the desktop layouts.
- Learning [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to use as templating engine within [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
- Revisited my [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars). Removed a lot of unused ones and added the interesting ones to my [Raindrop.io](https://rindrop.io) [public page](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData). The rest can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars).
- Learning about [HTTP Headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers) and how to apply them via `vercel.json` in the repository root.
  - [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/) is my choice to check headers and other security evaluations.
- Took up the [One HTML Page Challenge](onehtmlpagechallenge.com). Find my source code [here](https://github.com/semanticdata/one-html-page-challenge).
  - This is not a short term project. Planning to add things as I learn, etc.
- I dropped [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) in favor of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to use in my current project.
  - I'm also using [DaisyUI](daisyui.com/) that plays well with TailwindCSS.

### February

- Discovered NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/).
- After checking out [Astro](https://astro.build/), I decided it wasn't time to jump into it.
  - For now, using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) feels adequate given my knowledge level.
  - I will definitely give Astro another go, once I am more comfortable with [[Svelte]].
- Updated my [Obsidian Starter Vault](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) project.
  - Now includes more information about the CSS snippets, community plugins, and general workflows included in it.
- Forked these [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) [Minimal theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) [CSS Snippets](https://github.com/replete/obsidian-minimal-theme-css-snippets).
- Added new CSS Snippets to my vault. I'll probably end up posting them later.
- Republished my personal website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [elva](https://github.com/scottsweb/elva). Moved the site to `semanticdata.github.io`.
  - It is currently deployed with Vercel. Will use a different starter and drop `elva` soon.
- Contributions:
  - Added Spanish translations for [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) in [PR #822](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/pull/822).

### January

- Archived many of my inactive GitHub repositories.
- Compiled my GitHub stars in [this repo](https://github.com/semanticdata/github-stars) with the help of [maguowei/starred](https://github.com/maguowei/starred).
- Submitted Spanish translations for [gethyas/doks-core](https://github.com/gethyas/doks-core).
- Started playing around with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
  - Taking a look at [Eleventy Excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), and [Eleventy Garden](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden).
- Learned about [Astro](https://astro.build/). I'm playing around with it and some website starters.
- Discovered [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), and [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/).
- Fixed the search module not working in [Forgetful Notes](https://github.com/semanticdata/forgetful-notes).
- Gave [Firefox TabSpace](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-tabspace) a nice cleaning. Published updated version.

## 2023

### December

- Finally visited the [Dominican Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic) after more than 8 years without going.
  - I didn't really tell anyone about the trip. I just wanted to make sure I was able to actually go back at this time.
  - My main focus on the trip was to visit and spend time with family.
- Learned about [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). I'm checking it out as a CSS framework.
- Republished my personal [website](https://github.com/semanticdata/semanticdata.github.io) with [serene](https://github.com/isunjn/serene).
- Renamed Zola Dinkleberg to [Zola Guava](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-guava).
- Published new Firefox extension:
  - [ChatGPT in the Sidebar](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-chatgpt-in-sidebar)
  - [New Tab Notes](https://github.com/semanticdata/firefox-new-tab-notes) - This extension is helping me learn browser sync and storage management.

  - [Zola Minimal](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal)

### November

- Chrome extension [Text Revealer](https://github.com/jamigibbs/text-revealer-chrome-extension) was not available in Firefox, so I made a Firefox version.
- Updated my [Obsidian Starter](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) vault.
  - Now includes more information about backing up the vault and other general workflows.

  - I like the pair, but I paused working on this for now.
- Republished my old blog in Spanish: [Prose Poetry](https://github.com/semanticdata/prose-poetry).
  - Recently found the canonical blog I wrote in 2010 and republished it.
- Contributions:
  - Fixed bugs for [Zola Book](https://github.com/getzola/book) outlined in [Issue #18](https://github.com/getzola/book/issues/18).

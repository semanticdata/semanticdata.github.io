This page goes over how this website is built.

## 🖼 Background

This website has gone through many changes. I have not been shy about moving from technology to technology as I learn new things. Coming across the world of Static Site Generators was a game changer. I have ran my posts and notes through [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and most recently [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## 👀 Overview

The site is currently built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and canonically published via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/semanticdata/miguelpimentel.do) for the site.

## 🛠️ Technology

The site uses various technologies cobbled together. Here's some of them:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): website build tool for the modern web — powerful developer experience meets lightweight output.
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier): an opinionated code formatter.
- [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass): makes CSS fun!
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript): superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript output.
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): Git hooks made easy.

## 💜 Acknowledgements

I'd like to take the time to recognize the people and projects that made this one possible.

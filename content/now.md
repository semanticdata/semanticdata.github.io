# /now

A page about about what I'm focused on at this point in my life. Also known as a [/now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.

### As of January 2024, I am…

…tending to my [digital garden](https://forgetfulnotes.com/).  
…learning about web dev with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).  
…making simple browser [extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/17772574/).  
…collecting bookmarks with [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/SemanticData).  
…compiling [configuration files](https://github.com/semanticdata/dotfiles) in [GitHub](https://github.com/).  
…developing both a [theme](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-sample-theme), and a [starter vault](https://github.com/semanticdata/obsidian-starter-vault) for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

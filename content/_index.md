Hi, I'm Miguel. Problem solver, hobby developer, music enjoyer, and public infrastructure enthusiast based in Minnesota, USA. You can find me under different nicknames around (e.g. [Data](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/20296985/), [Ezra](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/User:Ezra_Salaz)). I think a lot, work a lot, have existential crises, and know just enough about making websites to make me dangerous. I enjoy writing, reading, coding, listening to music, and love having a problem to solve.

Would you like to know more? Consider checking out [/now](/now), [/uses](/uses), or my [digital garden](https://forgetfulnotes.com/).

Please tell your dog (or cat) I said "Hi"!
